Name of Quantlet: LSA_PC_rotation

Published in: Q3-D3-LSA

Description: 'The function "LSA.PC.rotation" determines the proper sign / rotation of the LSA components (semantic space principal components)
and extracts the top words (top_terms) of each component (PC) for the given LSA space which is created from the term document matrix TDM
of the Quantlets by means of the SVD process. The (positive and accordingly negative) part is chosen from those terms, where the biggest
subtotal is concentrated since the singular vectors are unique up to scalar multiples of modulus one, in the case of real matrices +/- 1.
Finally, the top words with the highest weights are taken as "prototypes" for the semantic space principal components’ topics (PC topics).
That way the function "LSA.PC.rotation" allows the determination of possible labels for the LSA PC’s.
The function requires as input the LSA space which is provided via the function "lsa" (from the R package lsa).
The remaining parameters of "LSA.PC.rotation" are optional allowing finer control of the output (number of PC’s, terms/topic etc.)'
