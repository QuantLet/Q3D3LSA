Name of Quantlet: LSA_heatmaps_sum

Published in: Q3-D3-LSA

Description: 'Big Data visualization of LSA via heat maps. Heat maps with color key of the LSA decomposition matrices are produced via gplots package.
m_a is the original term document matrix TDM (BVSM) containing Quantlets, m_lsa the corresponding representation in the LSA model
reduced to the Ô¨Årst k dimensions and error_matrix is the approximation error matrix of the SVD truncation.'

Keywords: data mining, text mining, term document matrix, quantnet, lsa, svd, descriptive-statistics, heat map, visualization
