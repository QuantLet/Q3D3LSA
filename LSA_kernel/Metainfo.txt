Name of Quantlet: LSA_kernel

Published in: Q3-D3-LSA

Description: 'Big Data visualization of LSA via heat maps. The LSA process is applied on the term document matrix TDM of the Quantlets.
Heat maps with color key of the semantic kernel and its subsets are produced via gplots package.
The semantic kernel U_kernel is extracted from the LSA space. For demonstration purpose some sub matrices are taken from the full
semantic kernel allowing the exact determination of "semantically correlated" term pairs.
Additionally, histograms of the semantic kernel values are plotted via ggplot2 package from different aspects.'

Example:
- 1: Histogram of the semantic kernel (full)
- 2: Histogram of the semantic kernel (zoomed)
- 3: Heat map of the full semantic kernel
- 4: Heat map of a randomly chosen 30 x 30 sub matrix of the semantic kernel (with term labels)
- 5: Heat map of a randomly chosen 30 x 30 sub matrix of the semantic kernel (with term labels)
- 6: Heat map of a randomly chosen 30 x 30 sub matrix of the semantic kernel (with term labels)
