Name of Quantlet: LSA_basics_hist_box

Published in: Q3-D3-LSA

Description: 'The SVD factor matrices U, V and the resulting LSA matrices m_lsa and error_matrix from the LSA process are extracted and calculated.
The LSA process is applied on the term document matrix TDM of the Quantlets.
Their histograms and boxplots are displayed using ggplot : Implementation of the Grammar of Graphics in R.'

Keywords: data mining, text mining, term document matrix, quantnet, lsa, svd, descriptive-statistics, boxplot, histogram, ggplot2
