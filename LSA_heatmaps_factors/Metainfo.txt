Name of Quantlet: LSA_heatmaps_factors

Published in: Q3-D3-LSA

Description: 'Big Data visualization of LSA via heat maps. Heat maps with color key of the LSA decomposition matrices are produced via gplots package.
The truncated SVD factor matrices U, V and d_s (diagonal Sigma matrix) are extracted from the LSA space.
The LSA process is applied on the term document matrix TDM of the Quantlets.'

Keywords: data mining, text mining, term document matrix, quantnet, lsa, svd, descriptive-statistics, heat map, visualization
